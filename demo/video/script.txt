Have you ever wanted to relive a wholesome moment?

Are you curious how certain events would play out?

DO YOU WANT TO MEET LEBRON?


With CREATE.world, you can build any world that you can imagine.
From a cozy memory you want to step back into, to a completely unreal universe where you set the rules. 
Show it, or even describe it, and watch it come to life in a fully explorable 3D world.

CREATE.world is a react app that leverages a variety of AI models for turning your imagination into a 3D world.
By integrating leading generative models such as MASt3R-SLAM for world generation, as well as Meta's latest SAM 3D for object generation, 
you can seamlessly build and add any elements to your world.

Further bridging the gap between your imagination and reality, we have added an additional layer on top of SAM 3D to generate object models from a decription. 
This layer uses Nano-banana from Google Gemini to transform your text into an image, which is then fed into SAM 3D.

To make this experience feel more immersive, you are able to explore your world through physical gestures, and even interact with objects to move them through space. 


DEMO OF PROJECT


While we have been able to achieve a lot of what we set out to do, and overcame a lot of hurdles, we still have many features that we could not fully implement due to various reasons. 
These features include connecting the engine to VR for an even more immersive experience, and potentially even sensored gloves for haptic feedback when interacting with objects.

None the less, we have accomplished our goal: to enable people to generate their world, only limited by their imagination. With CREATE.world, anyone can build 3D models effortlessly, and bring their world to life.
